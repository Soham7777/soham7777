# Hello, Tech Explorer! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile, where AI and ML meet innovation and curiosity. I'm passionate about exploring the realms of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to create real-world solutions.

## About Me 🎓

I'm a tech enthusiast with a full-time Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. My journey includes a year-long internship at a prominent product-based firm, where I had the opportunity to dive deep into the world of tech.

During this enriching experience, I cultivated proficiency in a variety of fields, including Python, Java, DevOps, SQL, and a plethora of machine learning libraries for data manipulation and extraction. I've also ventured into the world of model deployment, with hands-on expertise in FastAPI. My explorations extend to working with LLM APIs, Langchain, and Streamlit.

I'm constantly driven by a passion for technology and an eagerness to learn and innovate. Join me on this journey as we explore the endless possibilities of AI and ML!
## My Work 🚀

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

1. **Sentiment Analysis with BERT**: Sentiment classification of Amazon review data using a blend of deep learning with BERT encoders and traditional SVM. Dive into deep learning and SVM-based deployments with example screenshots.

2. **Blood Cell Identification**: Implemented a Convolutional Neural Network model based on U-net Architecture to identify normal and abnormal blood cells from real-time datasets provided by Manipal Hospital Labs.

3. **Customer Segmentation**: Leveraging machine learning techniques, including K-means Clustering, to enhance customer segmentation. Improving marketing strategies and maximizing profits through precise targeting.

4. **Tiny ML Model for Blind Curve Vehicle Detection**: Developed a lightweight ML model with a Deep Neural Network for real-time vehicle detection. Deployed on Raspberry Pi, it classifies noise and vehicles with confidence.

## Current Focus 🌐

I'm currently working on developing a chatbot using Langchain and OpenAI models. The aim is to create a domain-specific, up-to-date chatbot for financial needs.
