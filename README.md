# Hello, Tech Explorer! üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile, where AI and ML meet innovation and curiosity.

## About Me üéì

I'm a tech enthusiast with a full-time Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. My journey includes a year-long internship at a prominent product-based firm, where I had the opportunity to dive deep into the world of tech.

During this enriching experience, I cultivated proficiency in a variety of fields, including Python, Java, DevOps, SQL, and a plethora of machine learning and Deep Learning libraries for data manipulation and extraction. I've also ventured into the world of model deployment, with hands-on expertise in FastAPI. My explorations extend to working with LLM APIs, Langchain, and Streamlit.

I'm constantly driven by a passion for technology and an eagerness to learn and innovate. Join me on this journey to make the most out of the modern day gold mine called **DATA**

## My Work üöÄ

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

1. **DOMAIN-CENTRIC-CHATBOT (LLM-NLP)**:This project harnesses Langchain, OpenAI and Vector store DB to create a versatile chatbot, fine-tuned for specific domains, providing real-time access to the latest information. The working model is deployed with streamlit and ready to use for real time user interaction.
  
2. **Sentiment Analysis with BERT**: Sentiment classification of Amazon review data using a blend of deep learning with BERT encoders and traditional SVM. Dive into deep learning and SVM-based deployments with example screenshots.

3. **Blood Cell Identification**: Implemented a Convolutional Neural Network model based on U-net Architecture to identify normal and abnormal blood cells from real-time datasets provided by Manipal Hospital Labs.

4. **Customer Segmentation**: Leveraging machine learning techniques, including K-means Clustering, to enhance customer segmentation. Improving marketing strategies and maximizing profits through precise targeting.

5. **Tiny ML Model for Blind Curve Vehicle Detection**: Developed a lightweight ML model with a Deep Neural Network for real-time vehicle detection. Deployed on Raspberry Pi, it classifies noise and vehicles with confidence. [Link to the project](https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/public/79277/latest)


# Current Focus üåê

- **OPEN SOURCE** : Currently working with an Upwork offered task from [Unify AI](https://github.com/unifyai/ivy) , exploring ways to contribute towards the project which aims to include all the ML-DL frameworks such as  JAX, TensorFlow, PyTorch under one single framework.
